        <h2>Our Purpose</h2>

        <p>Nucleus was created to give every person an equal
          opportunity to learn about computers. Whether you want 
          to learn how to code, hack into your neighbor's wifi, or
          just know what the parts inside your computer are doing,
          we are here to help you. Our website is designed for 
          everyone from beginners to experienced computer nerds.
          As Hannah Montanna once said "If you're five or 82, this
          is something you can do". </p>

        <p>Our ultimate goal is to allow everyone to learn about 
          computer science on their own time while providing fun,
          free, and interactive learning modules.</p>

        <h2>Where to start?</h2>

        <p>If you have never worked with computers before, start with 
          our introduction course. This will teach you about all the 
          basics and a solid foundation for the rest of your learning.
          If you have a specific topic in mind, navigate through our many
          courses to find what you're looking for. If you have some 
          computer knowledge but not a lot, take our quiz to see where you
          should begin.
